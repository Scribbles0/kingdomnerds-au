A being made only known by his effect across the lands.
The strongest connection seems to be with [[King 'Mad Prince' John Moth]], but his presence is felt by **all**. As an evil god, they are clothed in the cloth of righteousness. What good is a devil if they are easily curbed? Those who believe refer to Armok Scrungus as a benevolent god, a God who gives by taking. The pain and suffering is a gift that is given, not forced upon.Â 

There is little to no information on the entity, as in there are no real rules this god follows.

At one point, a as you say "deranged" individual that spewed nonsense such as "meat nation" and "The Incident" nabbed a pen nib, and quickly drew THIS on a piece of parchment he found under a peasant's shoe. 

Few believe this is one of Armok Scrungus's forms, or at lease a vision of his being.
