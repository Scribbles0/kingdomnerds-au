As the name suggests, the kingdom of moths is mainly comprised of moths. The original royal bloodline started off as a group of moth in the first place. While older rulers allowed other species to enter their kingdom with open arms, the current ruler, [[King 'Mad Prince' John Moth]] will allow others to enter with a firm grip.

While believing all species to be equal, the Mad Prince removes all morality when it comes to usefulness. Lizards have proven to be a large cog in the workforce in the Kingdom of Moths. While not outright slavery, many know that much of the infrastructure within the kingdom would not be possible with out the help of the lizard kind. 

"Work? In the Heat? We have warm fur coats, I would never subject my people to that. Send the lizards, they're warmblooded."
