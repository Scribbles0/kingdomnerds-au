How to prepare Silktar, or "Silk-Nectar" a sweet often enjoyed by royal moths and nobles.

##### Introduction
Silktar is a finely woven piece of silk, usually cut out in fun shapes like stars or wing-shaped. These pieces of silk are dipped in a boiling pot of nectar from the local fields. Sugar works as well, but aristocratic moths claim that the nectar from flowers brings them closer to their ancestors.

Once dipped, the silk piece will soak up the nectar, removing the silk piece will cause the nectar to cool rapidly, hardening into a almost taffy-like consistency. Sugar will cause it to harden, and be crunchy. Nectar's cooled form is more sap-like in comparison.

Many cooks take this a little too far, and decorate their Silktar with much detail and almost ornate decorations.

More often than not, the pieces of cloth are pulled out with a spoon or fork, causing them to be somewhat malformed, but still a treat for any Moth. 

Don't overeat, they'll get the "buzz"
