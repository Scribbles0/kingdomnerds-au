#Moth 
- Would declare war on the Kingdom of Winter but is held back by his royal court
- Called 'Mad Prince' by those who have no respect for him due to his lust for war
- Son of the Late King [[Aranes Acari]]

A Brown moth, well kept and sharp. His dark demeanor is offset by the bright ornate cloaks he wears. He seems to float across the floor, though many believe this is because he drags his feet. You can still hear the light clacks of his steps. In his presence, the air is still, as if not allowed to move unless told. 

King 'Mad Prince' John Moth, a man that may be the end to his lineage. The royal blood in his veins are stained by his actions. The tales of his misdeeds and ridiculous monarchy is known far and wide. His citizens don't have a choice to leave. Many who come to visit are "persuaded" to stay. 

Many of the successful trade routes were established due to his exploitation of the land. Many fields, forests, rivers, and mines were crated under John Moth's rule, about 240% more preceding his parents. Of course, "volunteers" were utilized in the creation of most of these plantations and mines. 

The citizens who speak of revolt and revolution are shot down by non other than other citizens. Loyalists who have grown accustomed to John Moth's rule use these radicals as stepping stones to earn good standing with the [[Dark Wing]], by exposing schemes and basically snitching.

His methods are without a doubt cold-hearted at best. Cruelty is something the Mad Prince finds necessary to keep order. Laws are below the Mad Prince, as rules and precautions seem to bend according to what fits his needs or desires. 

During a large meeting with a large merchant group, a discussion about taxes was brought up. A majority of the peasants in the kingdom were simply unable to pay the high taxes that was presented to them. Sales would rarely be profitable due to the 40% sales tax imposed on all traders within the kingdom. 

Every merchant advised John Moth to lower the taxes to make the situation at lease bearable. 

Soon after, the same goods that were sold by the merchant group are now being sold by a new traders backed by none other than the King.

The merchant group, obviously displeased by their unfortunate circumstances, criticized the king for his unfairness.

The glint of a blade is not much different from that of a coin.
