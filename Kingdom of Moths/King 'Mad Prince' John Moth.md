- Would declare war on the Kingdom of Winter but is held back by his royal court
- Called 'Mad Prince' by those who have no respect for him due to his lust for war

King 'Mad Prince' John Moth, a man that may be the end to his lineage. The royal blood in his veins are stained by his actions. The tales of his misdeeds and ridiculous monarchy is known far and wide. His citizens don't have a choice to leave. Many who come to visit are "persuaded" to stay. 

Many of the successful trade routes were established due to his exploitation of the land. Many fields, forests, rivers, and mines were crated under John Moth's rule, about 240% more preceding his parents. Of course, "volunteers" were utilized in the creation of most of these plantations and mines. 

The citizens who speak of revolt and revolution are shot down by non other than other citizens. Loyalists who have grown accustomed to John Moth's rule use these radicals as stepping stones to earn good standing with the [[Dark Wing]], by exposing schemes and basically snitching.
