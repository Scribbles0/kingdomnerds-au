As the name suggests, the kingdom of moths is mainly comprised of moths. The original royal bloodline started off as a group of moth in the first place. While older rulers allowed other species to enter their kingdom with open arms, the current ruler, [[King 'Mad Prince' John Moth]] will allow others to enter with a firm grip.

While believing all species to be equal, the Mad Prince removes all morality when it comes to usefulness. Lizards have proven to be a large cog in the workforce in the Kingdom of Moths. While not outright slavery, many know that much of the infrastructure within the kingdom would not be possible with out the help of the lizard kind. 

The Kingdom itself is well built, the masonry is kept clean and sharp. Each brick is laid with precision and care. Years of financing and connections allowed John Moth to build what is basically a large capital up atop the mountainous region.

The Land stretches with lush green, speckled with large juts of rock and boulders. Rivers are fresh, and life is always thriving in this region. Due to the large population of moths, The environment rarely suffers from pollution or civilization. This is because these non-carnivorous bunches of fur feed upon mostly sap, fruit, and the elusive [[Silktar]] sweets.

#### "Work? In this blistering heat? We have warm fur coats, I would never subject my people to that. Send the lizards, they're warm-blooded." - John Moth
